1. What are media queries in CSS and their use case?

Media queries are a feature of CSS that allows you to apply different styles to a
webpage based on the characteristics of the device it is being displayed on. 

This can be useful for creating responsive designs that look good on a variety of
different devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.

2. Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS?

The min-width media query will match the specified CSS rules when the viewport width is equal to or exceeds the defined minimum width.

Where as the max-width media query will match the specified CSS rules when the viewport width is equal to or less than the defined maximum width.

3. Explain float property and clear property in CSS with examples.

The float property is used to make an element float to the left or right within its containing element, allowing other content to flow around it.

example:
.float-left {
  float: left;
}
.float-right {
  float: right;
}


The clear property is used to control how elements should behave in relation to floated elements.

example:
.clear-left {
  clear: left;
}
.clear-right {
  clear: right;
}
